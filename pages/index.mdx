**Notifir** is a boilerplate for your in-app notifications engine.

It's created to simplify the development of in-app notifications for your product. It provides the skeleton of the notification system. The essential functionality is available out of the box.

**Notifir** is a [notification widget](https://github.com/notifir/wc-notification-bell) built as a web component using [Lit framework](https://lit.dev) and [Notifications API](https://github.com/notifir/notifications-api) built using [Postgraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/).

You get the real-time in-app notifications component, which is possible to integrate into any web application, and clean GraphQL API, which is easy to customize and extend. You need less than 5 minutes to get started and make it running locally.
