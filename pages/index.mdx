**Notifir** is the open-source in-app notifications engine built for engineering teams.

It's created to simplify the development of in-app notifications for your product. It provides the skeleton of the notification system with essential functionality available out of the box.

You get the real-time in-app notifications component, which is possible to integrate into any web application, and clean GraphQL API, which is easy to customize and extend. You need less than 5 minutes to get started and make it running locally.
