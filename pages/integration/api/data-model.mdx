# Data Model

The core entity of Notifir is `Notification`. Notifications are sent to the users and shown in the widget. Users have access only to read their own notifications. Only `system` user can publish notification.

In order to have possibility to separate notifications data into groups and introduce a kind of multi-tenancy, the `Project` concept has been introduced. The `Project` is a top-level abstraction, which encapsulates the access control keys.

Notification itself is just a set of metadata. In the widget users can see the notification metadata mapped to the `Template`. `Templates` are stored in the DB next to the notifications and are linked to one of the `Projects`.
