# Customization

Once you've imported `notification-bell` component and started using it, you can customize it by adding your own styles.

If you want to modify the style, which is already externalized to variable, you can do it in the following way:

```html
<style>
  :root {
    --notification-bell-color: orange;
  }
</style>
...
<notification-bell></notification-bell>
```

You can also modify almost any style of the component in the following way:

```html
<notification-bell
    styles='{"bell": {"color":"black", "top": "50%"}, "container": {"width":"350px"}}'
></notification-bell>
```

<img src="/docs/04_widget_styles.png" />

You can also localize the widget UI to your custom text and language. Pass in these parameters within *messages* when
initializing. Each parameter is optional, and its default is used when it is not included.

| Parameter      | Type   | Description                                    |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| notifications  | String | Default: 'Notifications'                       |
| markAllAsRead  | String | Default: 'Mark all as read'                    |
| error          | String | Default: 'Something went wrong...'             |
| empty          | String | Default: 'You donâ€™t have any notifications...' |

```html
<notification-bell
    messages='{"markAllAsRead": "Mark all notifications as read"}'
></notification-bell>
```
