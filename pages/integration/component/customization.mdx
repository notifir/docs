# Customization

Once you've imported `wc-notification-bell` component and started using it, you can customize it by adding your own styles.

If you want to modify the style, which is already externalized to variable, you can do it in the following way:

```html
<style>
  :root {
    --wc-notification-bell-color: orange;
  }
</style>
...
<wc-notification-bell></wc-notification-bell>
```

You can also modify almost any style of the component in the following way:

```html
<style>
  wc-notification-bell {
    width: 50px;
  }

  wc-notification-bell div.header {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
...
<wc-notification-bell></wc-notification-bell>
```
